## Features
Add symbol table support

## Improvements/Experiments
Refactor parser to allow streaming model rather than reading whole file as once?


## Completed
Try speeding up parsing
 +/- moving from string join to io stream resulted in very small speedup
 + storing bit patterns as string rather than converting bits to string gave big
    big speedup (30%+)
 +/- Replacing command regex has benefit, but makes code more confusing:
                    Regex   No Regex
        A-Command   2.03    1.11
        C-Command   2.38    0.91
        L-Command   2.00    1.09

        Data taken from 3 iterations of PongL.asm (about 20k lines)

        Verdict: clean up new code and remove regex, regex is not very
        readable either so not losing much

 + should still save command type once calculated, since it's used in subsequent
    get_symbol call
 +/- pre-calculating all C-command bit combinations doesn't seem worth
    complicating the code, especially as we move toward streams. However it does
    speed up the _is_c_command() portion of get_command_type()
